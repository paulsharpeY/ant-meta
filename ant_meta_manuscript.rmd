\clearpage

A meta-analysis of all mindfulness research involving the ANT was used to assess whether the original
studies were sufficiently powered to detect effects, and to inform power calculations for further replications.

# Methods

## Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria

Say why ANT error scores weren't analysed (rarely see diffs?).

Studies of healthy adult populations (age 18 and above) with a mindfulness group, and ANT RTs as an outcome variable
were eligible for inclusion. Tai chi and hatha yoga interventions were excluded unless the training clearly emphasised
mindfulness. Studies were drawn from English language peer reviewed journal articles, published up to and including
2019.

Due to the small number of studies in this field, both cohort and case-control studies were included. Cohort studies
compare ANT performance in groups who complete a mindfulness intervention, with groups who complete one or more control
interventions. An 'intervention' could be a single meditation, or a longer period of mindfulness training. Case-control
studies are used to compare groups with differing levels of meditation experience. Groups are normally matched on a
range of factors, notably age, sex and education.

## Study Selection

The study was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses
[PRISMA\; @pagePRISMA2020Statement2020] guidelines. The term `("attention network test" OR "attention network task") AND
(meditat* OR mindfulness)` was used to search CINAHL (CINAHL Plus with Full Text, AMED, MEDLINE), Cochrane Library,
PsycInfo, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases in December 2019. Full text search options were selected where
available. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied to titles, abstracts and full text of eligible studies (see
\@ref(fig:ant-selection)). Tables \@ref(tab:ant-rct)--\@ref(tab:ant-nct) summarise the randomised, non-randomised and
non-controlled studies included in the meta-analysis. Requests were made to the original investigators where data
required for calculating effect sizes were unavailable in the published article.

## Data Analyses

Meta-analyses were stratified by study type (randomised or non-randomised) and the meditation experience of participants
(novice or experienced). Effect sizes and their confidence intervals were calculated for alerting, orienting and
executive attention RTs. Effect sizes for ANT error rates were not analysed, as they are rarely reported. Studies were
assessed using two risk of bias tools. The individually-randomised, parallel-group trials were assessed for bias arising
from the randomization process, deviations from the intended intervention, missing outcome data, outcome measurement,
and selection of the reported result, using the RoB 2 tool [@sterneRoBRevisedTool2019]. The non-randomised studies were
assessed for bias due to confounding, selection of participants, classification of interventions, deviations from the
intended intervention, missing data, outcome measurement, and selection of the reported result, using the ROBINS-I tool
[@sterneROBINSIToolAssessing2016]. Funnel plots were used to test for publication bias
[@sterneRecommendationsExaminingInterpreting2011].

Bayesian meta-analyses were conducted on the three ANT outcomes for the randomised and non-randomised studies. Effect
sizes for each study were calculated so that a positive number represented a better ANT score for the mindfulness
condition, where 'better' means higher alerting and orienting scores, and lower executive attention scores. For
case-control studies this means better ANT scores in the meditation condition relative to the control condition. For
cohort studies, this means a greater improvement in ANT scores over time in the meditation condition relative to the
control condition.

Effects were pooled for experienced and novice subgroups within each ANT outcome. A pooled standardised mean difference
(SMD) was estimated using a model which gave greater weight to studies with larger sample sizes. Study was included as a
random effect, as effect sizes were assumed to vary by study [@harrer13BayesianMetaAnalysis]. A normal (0,1) prior was
specified for the pooled effect estimate, on the basis that small effects are more likely than large effects, and that
positive or negative effects are equally likely. A half-Cauchy (0,.3) prior was specified for the standard deviation in
effect sizes. This gave most prior weight to small variations in the pooled effect, but still allowed some likelihood
for wider variance from the average effect size. A 95% highest-density continuous interval (HDCI) was calculated for
each study and also for the pooled effects. The HDCI is the shortest single range in which 95% of the posterior density
falls. This differs from the Highest Density Interval which can create multiple intervals if the posterior were bimodal
[@kruschkeDoingBayesianData2015]. The HDCI it is the range within which we are 95% sure that the true effect lies,
conditional on the data and model. Models were built using `brms` [@brms].

# Results

The database search produced 222 results, 85 of which were duplicates. From the remaining 137 items, 88 were excluded by
screening at the title and abstract level. Thirty of the remaining 49 items were excluded during full text screening.
These included non-mindfulness training studies (n=17), studies which used an outcome measure other than ANT (n=5),
study protocols without published data (n=3), review articles (n=2), and studies where participants were under 18 (n=1),
or reported subjective cognitive complaints (n=1). One study with negative baseline alerting and orienting scores
[@quanSevenDaysMindfulnessbased2018] was excluded because the ANT is not expected to produce negative scores
[@macleodAppraisingANTPsychometric2010, p.646]. Twenty-five experiments were included in the review, including the five
studies reported in this research, and one article containing two experiments [@tsaiAttentionalOrientingExecutive2016].

Sixteen experiments were included in the meta-analysis. Of the nine exclusions, RT data was unavailable for
@jhaMindfulnessTrainingModifies2007, Norris et al. [-@norrisBriefMindfulnessMeditation2018, Study 2],
@schancheCanClinicalPsychology2019,
@spadaroExploringEffectsOnline2016, @sperdutiProtectiveRoleLongterm2016, @tangShorttermMeditationTraining2007, and
@vandenhurkGreaterEfficiencyAttentional2010. Both the emotional ANT [@ainsworthEffectFocusedAttention2013], and the
modified ANT described by @elliottWeeklongMeditationRetreat2014 were considered to be too different to the majority of
ANT tasks to be included in the meta-analysis. For Tsai and Chou [-@tsaiAttentionalOrientingExecutive2016, Experiment
1], the comparison with the largest sample sizes was chosen. This was the comparison between meditators and
non-meditators, rather than the comparison between FA and OM in the meditation group.

Table \@ref(tab:ant-results) summarises the hypotheses and outcomes for all studies. Bold cells indicate that the effect
of mindfulness was greater than the control condition. The adjacent cell is also bold if this finding matched the
hypothesis. The outcomes in Table \@ref(tab:ant-results) are based on this author's interpretation of the results of
each study. In four cases [@becerraCanSpecificAttentional2017; @tsaiAttentionalOrientingExecutive2016, Experiments 1 and
2; @vandenhurkGreaterEfficiencyAttentional2010], this interpretation differed from that of the original author(s).

Effects of mindfulness on the ANT are consistently low, with no group differences in most studies. There were 13
comparisons where meditation improved executive attention, three where it improved alerting, two where it improved
orienting, and one where the control group scored higher on orienting than the meditation group.

Overall risk of bias for the randomized studies was moderate, and driven by three domains. Half of the studies showed
some concerns regarding randomisation procedures (Domain 1). A quarter of studies showed concerns or high risk of bias
due to deviations from the intervention (Domain 2). Three quarters of studies showed some concerns regarding selection
of the reported result (Domain 5), primarily because analysis plans were not pre-registered. Overall risk of bias in the
non-randomized studies was serious, and was driven three domains. Three quarters of studies were at serious risk of bias
due to confounding (Domain 1). All studies were at moderate or serious risk of bias due to deviations from the intended
interventions (Domain 4). Finally, all studies were at moderate risk of bias in selection of the reported result, again
because they did not pre-register an analysis plan.

The following meta-analyses estimate the true effect of meditation on the ANT in novices and experienced meditators.
Bayesian meta-analysis produces a posterior distribution which summarises the probabilities we assign to a range of
effect sizes. The HDCI is derived from this distribution, and shows the range within which we are 95% sure that the true
effect lies. Bayesian meta-analyses also allow us to make probability statements about effect sizes, which place
reasonable upper and lower bounds on the true effect of meditation on attention. Where effect sizes are not qualified,
they refer to the SMD (Hedges' *g*). Traditionally, SMDs of 0.2, 0.5 and 0.8 are are considered small, medium and large
respectively [@cohenPowerPrimer1992]. When interpreting the ANT, improved performance is traditionally indicated by
higher alerting and orienting scores, and lower executive attention lower scores
[@fanTestingEfficiencyIndependence2002]. To simplify the meta-analysis results, values have been adjusted so that
positive values for all ANT scores reflect improvements in the meditation condition. A HDCI which does not overlap zero
provides certainty over the direction of an effect.

The meta-analyses included eight effects for novices, all from randomised studies, and five effects for experienced
meditators from non-randomised studies. The only randomised experiments involving experienced meditators were studies 2
and 3 in the current research. Funnel plots indicated that SMD estimates for alerting, orienting and executive attention
were not affected by publication bias (see Supplementary Materials).

```{r effect-probabilities}
# small = 0.2, medium = 0.5, large = 0.8
p_effect <- read_meta_ant_data('p_effect') %>%
  mutate(across(small:neg_medium, ~round(.x * 100)))
```

### Executive attention

```{r forest-executive, fig.align='center', fig.cap="Forest plot for alerting", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/all-executive.png")
```

The pooled effect for novices in Figure \@ref(fig:forest-executive) shows evidence of a small improvement (*SMD* = 0.14) in executive attention. Based on the data observed, there is a 
`r with(p_effect, small[type == 'rct' & experience == 'Novice' & var == 'conflict'])`% chance that the effect is > 0.2,
and a
`r with(p_effect, medium[type == 'rct' & experience == 'Novice' & var == 'conflict'])`% chance that it is > 0.5. For the randomised studies involving experienced meditators, Figure \@ref(fig:forest-executive) shows a very small (*SMD* = 0.05) pooled effect. There is a
`r with(p_effect, small[type == 'rct' & experience == 'Experienced' & var == 'conflict'])`% chance that the effect is > 0.2,
and a
`r with(p_effect, medium[type == 'rct' & experience == 'Experienced' & var == 'conflict'])`% chance that it is > 0.5.

There is evidence of a slightly
larger effect of meditation (*SMD* = 0.15) than in the randomised studies. There is a
`r with(p_effect, small[type == 'ct' & experience == 'Experienced' & var == 'conflict'])`% chance that the effect
is > 0.2.

### Alerting

```{r forest-alerting, fig.align='center', fig.cap="Forest plot for alerting", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/all-alerting.png")
```

The pooled effect for novices in Figure \@ref(fig:forest-alerting) shows minimal effects (*SMD* = 0.01) of
meditation on alerting in novices. Based on the data observed, there is a
`r with(p_effect, small[type == 'rct' & experience == 'Novice' & var == 'alerting'])`% chance that the effect is > 0.2.
One study [@sharpeEffectsMindfulnessMeditation2021, Experiment 4] found the reverse effect -- that alerting was better
in the control condition than the experimental condition. For the randomised studies
involving experienced meditators, Figure \@ref(fig:forest-alerting) also shows a small (*SMD* = 0.18) improvement
in alerting. There is a
`r with(p_effect, small[type == 'rct' & experience == 'Experienced' & var == 'alerting'])`% chance that the effect is > 0.2,
and a
`r with(p_effect, medium[type == 'rct' & experience == 'Experienced' & var == 'alerting'])`% chance that it is > 0.5.
There is also a
`r with(p_effect, neg_small[type == 'rct' & experience == 'Experienced' & var == 'alerting'])`% chance that meditation
has a negative effect on alerting, with an effect size > 0.2.

Figure \@ref(fig:forest-alerting) shows results for the non-randomised studies. There is minimal
evidence (*SMD* = 0.04) that meditation improves alerting. There is a
`r with(p_effect, small[type == 'ct' & experience == 'Experienced' & var == 'alerting'])`% chance that the effect is > 0.2,
and a
`r with(p_effect, neg_small[type == 'ct' & experience == 'Experienced' & var == 'alerting'])`% chance 
that meditation has a negative effect on alerting, with an effect size > 0.2.

### Orienting

```{r forest-orienting, fig.align='center', fig.cap="Forest plot for alerting", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/all-orienting.png")
```

The pooled effect for novices in Figure \@ref(fig:forest-orienting) shows that meditation has a very small (*SMD* = -0.07), negative effect on orienting. Based on the data observed, there is a
`r with(p_effect, neg_small[type == 'rct' & experience == 'Novice' & var == 'orienting'])`% chance that this effect is > 0.2,
and a `r with(p_effect, neg_medium[type == 'rct' & experience == 'Novice' & var == 'orienting'])`% chance that it is > 0.5.
There is also a
`r with(p_effect, small[type == 'rct' & experience == 'Novice' & var == 'orienting'])`% chance that meditation has a positive effect on orienting, with an effect size > 0.2. For the randomised studies involving experienced meditators, Figure \@ref(fig:forest-orienting) also shows a small (*SMD* = -0.19), negative orienting effect, mostly driven by Sharpe [-@sharpeEffectsMindfulnessMeditation2021, Experiment 2]. There is a
`r with(p_effect, neg_small[type == 'rct' & experience == 'Experienced' & var == 'orienting'])`% chance that the effect is > 0.2, and a
`r with(p_effect, neg_medium[type == 'rct' & experience == 'Experienced' & var == 'orienting'])`% chance that it is > 0.5.
There is also a
`r with(p_effect, small[type == 'rct' & experience == 'Experienced' & var == 'orienting'])`% chance that meditation improves
orienting in experienced meditators, with an effect size > 0.2, and a
`r with(p_effect, medium[type == 'rct' & experience == 'Experienced' & var == 'orienting'])`% chance that this effect is > 0.5.

Figure \@ref(fig:forest-orienting) shows results for the non-randomised studies. There is minimal evidence that
meditation improves alerting (*SMD* = 0.03). There is a
`r with(p_effect, small[type == 'ct' & experience == 'Experienced' & var == 'orienting'])`% chance that the effect is > 0.2.

## Meta-analysis {#app-ant-meta}

### ANT scores

\begin{equation}
Alerting = RT_{no-cue} - RT_{double\ cue} (\#eq:alerting)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
Orienting  = RT_{centre\ cue} - RT_{spatial\ cue} (\#eq:orienting)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
Conflict = RT_{flanker\ incongruent} - RT_{flanker\ congruent} (\#eq:conflict)
\end{equation}

### Meta-analysis

The meta-analysis for each ANT variable was built using the `brmsformula`

\begin{equation}
smd | se(se) \sim 1 + (1 | study)
\end{equation}

This models the study SMD `smd` and its standard error `se(se)` in terms of an overall intercept `1` (fixed effect), and
a random effect for each study `(1 | study)`.

### Supporting formulas {#supporting-formulas}

\begin{equation}
SE = \frac{CI95_{upper} - CI95_{lower}}{3.92} (\#eq:se)
\end{equation}

95% confidence interval for Cohen's d [@rosnowEffectSizesWhy2009].

\begin{equation}
df = n1 + n2 - 2
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
CI95 = \sqrt{\left(\frac{n_1 + n_2}{n_1n_2} + \frac{d^2}{2df} \right) \frac{n_1 + n_2}{df}} (\#eq:ci95)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
SD_{pooled} = \sqrt{\frac{(n_1 - 1)SD_1^2 + (n_2 - 1)SD_2^2}{n_1 + n_2 - 2}} (\#eq:sd)
\end{equation}

For each _ANT_ score (_Alerting_, _Orienting_, _Conflict_), equation \@ref(eq:antsmd) defines the standardized mean
difference (SMD) between groups. This formula is Hedges' _g_ [@higginsChapterChoosingEffect2019, Section 6.5.1.2].

\begin{equation}
SMD = \frac{mean(ANT_{group1}) - mean(ANT_{group2})}{SD_{pooled}(n_{group1}, n_{group2}, sd(ANT_{group1}), sd(ANT_{group2}))} (\#eq:antsmd)
\end{equation}

@joMeditationAttentionControlled2016 and @tsaiAttentionalOrientingExecutive2016 reported standard errors. These were
  converted to standard deviations using equation \@ref(eq:se2sd) [@higginsChapterChoosingEffect2019, Section 6.5.2.2].

\begin{equation}
SD = SE \times \sqrt{n} (\#eq:se2sd)
\end{equation}

@kwakEnhancedAttentionalNetwork2020 did not include standard deviations for pre and post ANT scores by condition. These
  were imputed using equation \@ref(eq:sdimpute), which is based on Higgins et al. [-@higginsChapterChoosingEffect2019,
  Section 6.5.2.2]. In each calculation, $ant1$ and $ant2$ are the trial types used to compute the alerting, orienting
  or executive ANT score, and $Corr$ was calculated using data from Study 5 as the correlation between the mean RT by
  participant for the same trial types.

\begin{equation}
SD_{imputed} = \sqrt{SD^2_{ant1} + SD^2_{ant2} - (2 \times Corr \times SD_{ant1} \times SD_{ant2})} (\#eq:sdimpute)
\end{equation}

## Results

### Meta-analysis

#### Risk of bias: Randomised studies

Figure \@ref(fig:ant-rob-traffic) summarises the risk of bias assessments for the randomised studies. The traffic-light
plots in this and Figure \@ref(fig:ant-robins-traffic) were generated using `robvis` [@robvis]. Concerns in Domain 1
related to the randomisation method, which was either unspecified, or potentially non-random. Only
@walshEffectsMindfulnessMeditation2019 specified that the allocation sequence was concealed until participants were
  assigned to interventions. In Domain 2, one study [@ainsworthEffectFocusedAttention2013] was assessed as being at high
  risk of bias, because there was no information about whether participants complied with the assigned daily meditation.
  There were some concerns that the lack of supervision in Study 3 in the current research risked non-adherence to
  interventions that could have affected participants' outcomes. In Domain 5, concerns regarding bias in the reported
  result were for studies which did not pre-register an analysis plan.

```{r ant-rob-traffic, fig.pos = "h", out.extra = "", out.width = "70%", fig.align="center", fig.cap="Risk of Bias in individually-randomised studies, assessed using RoB 2."}
rob2 <- read_csv(paste0(meta_ant_data_dir, '/rob2.csv'))
rob_traffic_light(data = rob2 %>% select(-Weight) %>% mutate(Study = gsub("Experiment ", "E", .$Study)), psize=5, tool = "ROB2")
```

#### Risk of bias: Non-randomised studies

Figure \@ref(fig:ant-robins-traffic) summarises risk of bias assessments for the non-randomised studies, including the
two studies without control conditions [@schancheCanClinicalPsychology2019; @spadaroExploringEffectsOnline2016]. Many of
these were case-control studies involving long-term meditators. Long-term meditators might systematically differ from
controls in many ways other than their lifetime meditation duration. For example, an *innate* ability to focus attention
might attract people to meditation, but their long-term practice may have little or no effect on attention. In Domain 1,
studies which included a long-term meditator group [@isbelCognitiveMechanismsMindfulness2015;
@jhaMindfulnessTrainingModifies2007;
@joMeditationAttentionControlled2016; @ottenPsychophysiologyDurationEstimation2015;
@schotzTimePerceptionMindfulness2016;
@sperdutiProtectiveRoleLongterm2016; @tsaiAttentionalOrientingExecutive2016 Experiment 1;
@vandenhurkGreaterEfficiencyAttentional2010; @wittmannSubjectiveExpansionExtended2015] were rated as being at serious
risk of confounding, because these additional variables were not measured or controlled for. For similar reasons, these
studies were classified as being at serious risk of bias due to deviation from intended interventions (Domain 4).
Long-term meditators are also likely differ from controls in ways which should be treated as "co-interventions"
[@sterneROBINSIToolAssessing2016]. For example, many Buddhist meditators maintain a number of ethical precepts e.g. a
commitment to restrain their speech and actions, potentially leading to cognitive and behavioural differences which
should also be controlled for. A complete list of co-interventions would be extensive, difficult to measure and
impossible to control for. Also in Domain 4, @schancheCanClinicalPsychology2019 and @spadaroExploringEffectsOnline2016
were assessed as being at moderate risk of bias, due to their lack of a control condition. All studies were assessed as
being at moderate risk or above for bias in selection of the reported result (Domain 7), as they did not pre-register an
analysis plan.

```{r ant-robins-traffic, fig.pos = "h", out.extra = "", fig.cap="Risk of bias in non-randomised studies, assessed using ROBINS-I.", out.width = "70%", fig.align="center"}
robins <- read_csv(paste0(meta_ant_data_dir, '/robins.csv')) %>% mutate(Study = str_trunc(Study, 25))
rob_traffic_light(data = robins %>% select(-Weight), psize=5, tool = "ROBINS-I")
```

#### Risk of bias across studies

Figures \@ref(fig:ant-rob-summary) and \@ref(fig:ant-robins-summary) summarise risks of bias across the randomized and
non-randomized studies respectively^[All studies were equally weighted in these analyses.].

```{r ant-rob-summary, fig.pos = "!h", out.width = "60%", fig.align="center", fig.cap='Risk of bias across randomised studies.'}
rob_summary(data = rob2, tool = "ROB2")
```

```{r ant-robins-summary, fig.pos = "!h", out.width = "60%", fig.align="center", fig.cap='Risk of bias across non-randomised studies.'}
rob_summary(data = robins, tool = "ROBINS-I")
```

#### Funnel plots

The funnel plot in Figure \@ref(fig:executive-funnel) shows, for each study, the estimate of the SMD for executive
attention, against the study's standard error. A funnel plot is a scatterplot of study effect size estimates against
their sample size or precision [@sterneRecommendationsExaminingInterpreting2011]. The standard error is representative
of sample size, so studies with larger samples and power are positioned higher on the y axis (as the standard error
decreases). Effect estimates from smaller studies should scatter more widely at the bottom of the plot, and narrow as
sample sizes increase, creating an inverted funnel shape. In the absence of bias the solid and dotted triangles, centred
on the pooled effect size estimate, will include about 95%, and 99% of studies respectively. Asymmetry around the effect
size estimate can indicate publication bias [@sterneRecommendationsExaminingInterpreting2011]. Figure
\@ref(fig:executive-funnel) is symmetrical, which indicates that the executive attention SMD estimates were not affected
by publication bias.

```{r executive-funnel, fig.pos = "h", out.width='80%', fig.align='center', fig.cap="Funnel plot showing meta-analytic executive attention SMD against study size/precision."}
funnel_plot(read_meta_ant_data('conflict_funnel_data'))
```

The funnel plot in Figure \@ref(fig:alerting-funnel) is symmetrical about the pooled effect size, so there is no
evidence that the alerting SMD estimates were affected by publication bias.

```{r alerting-funnel, fig.pos = "h!", out.width='80%', fig.align='center', fig.cap="Funnel plot showing meta-analytic alerting SMD against study size/precision."}
funnel_plot(read_meta_ant_data('alerting_funnel_data'))
```

The funnel plot in Figure \@ref(fig:orienting-funnel) is symmetrical about the pooled effect size, so there is no
evidence that the orienting SMD estimates were affected by publication bias.

```{r orienting-funnel, fig.pos = "!h", out.width='80%', fig.align='center', fig.cap="Funnel plot showing meta-analytic orienting SMD against study size/precision."}
funnel_plot(read_meta_ant_data('orienting_funnel_data'))
```
